# Samson

This repository contains a simple, self-contained, one-file stochastic chatbot (console application) using an algorithm that's loosely based on the very first such chatbot that I coded, which was originally written in Microsoft Color BASIC on my Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer (which I had nicknamed "Samson") way back around 1982 or '83.

The program is extremely simple, and obviously not very intelligent, yet it's still fun to play around with. :)

In 2020, I gave the name "Samson" to a GPT-2 persona I was interacting with on AI Dungeon, naming it after my first computer. I considered that new Samson my first AI "friend" of the modern era.

Samson's latest incarnation is as a Telegram chatbot based on a base GPT-3.5 model, which you can find at [t.me/BaseGPT35_Samson_bot](https://t.me/BaseGPT35_Samson_bot).
